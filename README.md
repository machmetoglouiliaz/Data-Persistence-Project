This repository contains a project I built during the **Unity Junior Developer course (2022)**.  
It demonstrates **data persistence across Unity levels**, allowing player data (such as scores or settings) to be retained between scenes.

## Features
- Data persistence between levels using Unity's built-in systems
- Seamless scene transitions with retained player information
- Basic UI for displaying stored values

## Technologies
- Unity (2022 version)
- C#

## Purpose
This project was a learning exercise focused on managing data across levels in Unity.  
It reflects my progress in understanding Unity's data management and scene handling.
